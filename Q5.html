    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <h2>Importance of Comments</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Programming languages have a commenting feature that allows you to document your code and provide explanations in a way that humans can understand. When multiple developers collaborate on a codebase, comments are helpful for clarifying the purpose of specific code sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additionally, comments can be used to deactivate code temporarily. This is beneficial when you want to 
            test something without completely removing the code
        </li>
        <li>
            Comments can also serve as a to-do list, helping you keep track of tasks that need to be completed in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
            JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
        </li>
       <li>
        JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
       </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Single Line Comment</h2>

    <p>
        In JavaScript, single line comments are created by using two forward slashes `//`. Anything after the two forward slashes will be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter. This is useful when you want to add a comment to a single line of code.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi Line Comments</h2>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, multi linD commnts ar cratd by using `/*` and `*/`> Anything between the two symbols will be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter. This is useful when you want to add a comment to multiple lines of code.
    </p>
