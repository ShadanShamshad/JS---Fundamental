    <!-- List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript. -->
   
    <h1>Five primitive data types in JavaScript</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><span>String :</span>
         Combination of alphanumeric characters wrapped in either single or double quotes or in backticks. Strings can include any number, letter or symbol.
         <p>
            For Example:-
            <br>
            const name = 'ram'; (Single Quote)
            <br>
            const name1 = "hari";   (Double Quotes)
            <br>
            const result = `The names are ${name} and ${name1}`; (Backticks)
         </p>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li><span>Number :</span>
            Any number in JavaScript is the Number type, including floats and decimals. Some langu1ges have separate types for floats and integers. JavaScript does not. Numbers are not wrapped in quotes.
            <p>
                For Example:-
                <br>
                const number1 = 3;
                <br>
                const number2 = 3.433;
            </p>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li><span>Null :</span>
            Null means nothing or empty value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or property has no value.
            <br>
            <br>
            <mark>Note:</mark> null is not the same as NULL or Null.
            <p>
                For Example:-
                <br>
                const number = null;
                <br>
                <h4>The code above suggests that the number variable is empty.</h4>
            </p>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li><span>Undefined :</span>
            undefined is a special value that indicates that a variable or property has been declared but has not been assigned a value
            <p>
                For Example:-
                <br>
                <br>
                let name;
                <br>
                console.log(name); // undefined
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>It is also possible to explicitly assign a variable value.</b>
                <br>
                let name = undefined;
                <br>
                console.log(name); // undefined
                <h4> <mark>Note:</mark> It is recommended not to explicitly assign undefined to a variable. Usually, null is used to assign 'unknown' or 'empty' value to a variable.</h4>
            </p>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li><span>Boolean :</span>
            A boolean is a true or false value.
            This data type represents logical entities. Boolean represents one of two values: true or false. It is easier to think of it as a yes/no switch.
            <p>
                For Example:- 
                const dataChecked = true;
                <br>
                const valueCounted = false;
            </p>
           <hr>

        </li>
    </ol>
