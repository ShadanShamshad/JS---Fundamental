    <!-- Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development. -->
        <p>
        <b><u>JavaScript</u></b> is a popular programming language that is widely used to build web applications. It is a <mark> client-side scripting language</mark>, which means that it is <mark> run by the web browser</mark> rather than on a server. Javascript is also used to <mark>build mobile apps, create interactive documents, and build server-side applications</mark> <b> with the help of </b> <mark>runtime environments such as Node.js</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a <mark>high-level language</mark>, which means that it is <mark>easy to learn and use</mark>. It is <mark>also a dynamically-typed language</mark>, which means that we don't have to specify the type of a variable when we declare it, making it easy to write code quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
        JavaScript is a very flexible and powerful programming language. It is used in many different areas because it can work both in web browsers and on servers.
        </p>
        <p>
        JavaScript is primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic elements to websites. It allows developers to create responsive user interfaces handle user interactions and update Web page content without requiring a full page reload.
        </p>
        <p>
        With the help of modern JavaScript frameworks like React Angular and Vue.js developers can build powerful and complex web applications that provide a smooth user experience similar to traditional desktop applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        JavaScript's support for asynchronous programming makes it ideal for building real-time applications like chat applications collaborative tools and live data dashboard.

<!-- This makes it a good choice for building web applications that needs to be fast and responsive, as the code is run locally on the user's device rather than having to be sent back and forth between a server and a clientt. -->
