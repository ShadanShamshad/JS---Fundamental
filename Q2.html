    <h2>Key Differences between JavaScript and HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b><u>Purpose:</u></b> HTML is used for creating the structure and content of a web page, while JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to a web page.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b><u>Syntax:</u></b> HTML uses markup tags to define elements, while JavaScript uses scripting language syntax.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b><u>Rendering:</u></b> HTML is rendered by the browser, while JavaScript is executed by the browser.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        With the arrival of HTML5 and WebGL JavaScript has become a practical option for making games that can be played directly in web browsers. Game engines like Phaser and Three.js make it easy for developers to create fun and visually attractive games using JavaScript`
